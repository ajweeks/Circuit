--Tiles--
-have a type which is a field from TileType.java enum
-have a direction (stored in the form of a Direction.java enum field); 
   -inverter: NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST
   -wire: NONE
   -power: NONE
   -blank: NONE
-have an alive boolean storing whether or not it is being powered
-have a boolean[] of 4 elements to store which of their neighbors are not blank (for automatic connecting-ness), in the order of: {north, east, south, west};
-inverter tiles have 4 neighbors, but only "care" about the ones that are in front and behind

--TO DO LIST--
-Get rid of extra inverter sprites, instead use code to rotate them
-Fix white box rendering when a save or load window is opened
-Modify the currently hacky way of getting input

--COMPLETED ITEMS--
-Fix lingering power which does not go away after the removal of a power source
-Update entire grid before rendering, to eliminate slow moving "electricity" from bottom right corner to top left corner
-Fix wire auto-connection issues
-Fix saving / loading the board 
-Make inverters have four directions, and only allow current to pass through one direction
