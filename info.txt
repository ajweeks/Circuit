--Tiles--
-have a type which is a field from TileType.java enum
-have a direction (stored in the form of a Direction.java enum field); 
   -inverter: NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST
   -wire: NONE
   -power: NONE
   -blank: NONE
-have an alive boolean storing whether or not it is being powered
-have a boolean[] of 4 elements to store which of their neighbors are not blank (for automatic connecting-ness), in the order of: { north, east, south, west };

--TO DO LIST--
!!-Fix lingering power which does not go away after the removal of a power source
     -Maybe by "following" the power through each wire instead of just checking if neighbors are powered
     -Make inverters have four directions, and only allow current to pass through one direction
!!-Fix saving / loading the board 
-Update entire grid before rendering, to eliminate slow moving "electricity" from bottom right corner to top left corner
-Implement a burn out system to prevent endless loops of cpu-melting atrocities
-Get rid of extra inverter sprites, instead use code to rotate them
-Fix white box rendering when a save or load window is opened right away

--COMPLETED ITEMS--
-Fix wire auto-connection issues
