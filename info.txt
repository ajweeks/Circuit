--Tiles--
-have a type which is a TileType enum
-have a direction; 
   -inverter: NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST
   -wire: NONE
   -power: NONE
   -blank: NONE
-have an alive boolean storing whether or not it is being powered
-have a boolean[] of 4 elements to store which of their neighbors are not blank (for automatic connecting-ness)

--TO DO LIST--
!!-Fix lingering power which does not go away after the removal of a power source
     -Maybe by "following" the power through each wire instead of just checking if neighbors are powered
     -Make inverters have four directions, and only allow current to pass through one direction
-Update entire grid before rendering, to eliminate slow moving "electricity" from bottom right corner to top left corner
-Implement a burn out system to prevent endless loops of cpu-melting atrocities
-Get rid of extra inverter sprites, instead use code to rotate them

--COMPLETED ITEMS--
-Fix wire auto-connection issues
